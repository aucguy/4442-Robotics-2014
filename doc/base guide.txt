This is a guide of how to use base.c

--concepts--
There is something called an Action, which is really a function.
You can start or stop an action. When an action is running, it gets called each tick.

--using
First you're going to want to include the header
	#include "base.h"

Next you'll want to implement the action function
	bool someAction(int time)
	{
		//do stuff
		return true;
	}
This should return whether or not to continue the function and takes the arguement
of the time the action started

Then you need to add the following line
	declareAction(someAction) //notice how there is no ';' don't include it!

Then add the following line to updateRobot in base.c
	updateAction(someAction)

That's all you need to do
